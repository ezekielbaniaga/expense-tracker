Last investigation: 2026-10-13 00:01 — 11 new findings

Findings from the project review on 2026-10-12, plus later investigations. Paths are relative to
`spring-boot-maven-sample/backend/src/main/java/ezekiel/baniaga/springboot/maven/backend/`.

Work items top to bottom, one per commit. When an item is fixed, move it to **Done** with its
commit hash. Items that need a human decision or action outside the code go in **Needs you**.

## Tests

- [ ] **`/auth/login` has no tests.** Nothing covers a correct login (tokens returned, session row with user
      agent and IP), a wrong password, an unknown user, or a disabled user. All should be 401 except the first.

## Needs you

- [ ] Old secrets from `docker_compose/.env` remain in git history. Rotate them before any real deployment.
- [ ] **Decide on login brute-force protection.** `/auth/login` allows unlimited password attempts. Options:
      per-username/IP throttling in the app (in-memory, so per instance), a library like Bucket4j, or rate
      limiting at a reverse proxy. Which one depends on how you'll deploy.

## Done

- [x] Compose passed `ADMIN_USER` but the app reads `ADMIN_USERNAME` (683ec2f)
- [x] `logging` was nested under `spring` in `application.yml`, so it was ignored (ef0a319)
- [x] `.env` with secrets was tracked; replaced with `.env.example` (3a188fd)
- [x] Context test needed a live local Postgres; now uses Testcontainers (8111665)
- [x] Refresh token reuse now revokes the whole session (5b27672)
- [x] Concurrent refreshes with the same token are serialized by a row lock; losers count as reuse (09c4ed0)
- [x] Refresh rotation returns `CustomUserDetails` mapped inside the transaction, not a lazy `User` (81eaf15)
- [x] Disabled users can no longer refresh; their session is revoked (f74c6aa)
- [x] `POST /auth/logout` revokes the session of the given refresh token (22d3bc2)
- [x] Expenses are scoped to their owner; other users' expenses return 404 (7a70240)
- [x] Expense delete is transactional, checks `?version=`, and rejects archived expenses (4e9e344)
- [x] `spring-boot-starter-flyway-test` is test-scoped; 26 test jars no longer ship in the production jar (58d7ead)
- [x] JWT filter parses each token once and the signing key is cached (b2c8648)
- [x] Error responses keep their real status (400/500) instead of turning into 401 (08409d5)
- [x] Expense amount and date are required; v1.1 total skips legacy rows without amount (b2084ff)
- [x] Expense amount is validated against `NUMERIC(10,2)`; overflow and extra decimals give 400 (cd83e05)
- [x] 404 responses are `ErrorResponse` JSON like every other error (199601c)
- [x] `X-API-Version` accepts `v`/`V` prefixes (`v1.0`, `V1.1`, `v1`) (2557e9a)
- [x] Nightly job deletes sessions ended over 7 days ago, with their used token hashes (610162f)
- [x] Startup rejects a `JWT_SECRET` shorter than 32 bytes instead of failing every login (65e4816)
- [x] Docker Compose starts the app only after Postgres passes a `pg_isready` healthcheck (78d0beb)
- [x] App container runs as an unprivileged `app` user instead of root (8a401f1)
